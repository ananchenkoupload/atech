Friends and colleagues full of laughter and excitement approached the valet, handing off the keys and disappearing into the night club. As they entered the aroma of Russian leather and warm amber wafted into the streets. I was greeted by a beautiful hostess who prompted me towards the entrance with a smile. The contrast of antique building exterior transitioned into a luxurious interior full of individual extravagances and wealth. The passionate and lustful scent of champagne corks popping filled the room. The comforting aroma of black tea brewing in the distance drifted across the air. A night to remember, lavishment and lust.",

A state of the art, extravagant and exotic city; preserving distinctive traditions while welcoming the new. The fragrance of jammy red roses wafted over me as I passed by elegant Arabic women dressed in black abayas. Their husbands contrasting in white dishdashas.

I was in a meditative state. The breeze carried the scent of sakura cherry blossoms and citrus notes. It stirred through the leaves of the Hinoki Trees and down the glistening streets.
